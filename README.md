# breast-cancer-prediction
Solving a binary classification problem of classifying breast tumours as malignant or benign. The dataset is aqcuired from UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
I've used 5 different classification method

* Keras simple Neural Net.
* Sklearn Decision Tree.
* Sklearn KNN
* Sklearn Naive Bayes
* Sklearn Random Forest
* Sklearn Support Vector Classifier


## Getting Started

Just Download the project and run the script train.py using python 3.6+

### Prerequisites

* Install Python 3.6 or 3.6+
* Install Sklearn, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Tensorflow and Keras.
